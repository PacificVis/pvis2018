<h2 id="paper-types">PAPER TYPES</h2>
<p>A VIS paper typically falls into one of five categories: technique, system, design study, evaluation, or model. We briefly discuss these categories below. Although your main paper type has to be specified during the paper submission process, papers can include elements of more than one of these categories. Please see “Process and Pitfalls in Writing Information Visualization Research Papers” by Tamara Munzner for more detailed discussion on how to write a successful VIS paper.</p>
<p><strong>Technique papers</strong> introduce novel techniques or algorithms that have not previously appeared in the literature, or that significantly extend known techniques or algorithms, for example by scaling to datasets of much larger size than before or by generalizing a technique to a larger class of uses. The technique or algorithm description provided in the paper should be complete enough that a competent graduate student in visualization could implement the work, and the authors should create a prototype implementation of the methods. Relevant previous work must be referenced, and the advantage of the new methods over it should be clearly demonstrated. There should be a discussion of the tasks and datasets for which this new method is appropriate, and its limitations. Evaluation through informal or formal user studies, or other methods, will often serve to strengthen the paper, but are not mandatory.</p>
<p><strong>System papers</strong> present a blend of algorithms, technical requirements, user requirements, and design that solves a major problem. The system that is described is both novel and important, and has been implemented. The rationale for significant design decisions is provided, and the system is compared to documented, best-of-breed systems already in use. The comparison includes specific discussion of how the described system differs from and is, in some significant respects, superior to those systems. For example, the described system may offer substantial advancements in the performance or usability of visualization systems, or novel capabilities. Every effort should be made to eliminate external factors (such as advances in processor performance, memory sizes or operating system features) that would affect this comparison. For further suggestions, please review “How (and How Not) to Write a Good Systems Paper” by Roy Levin and David Redell, and “Empirical Methods in CS and AI” by Toby Walsh.</p>
<p><strong>Application / Design Study papers</strong> explore the choices made when applying visualization and visual analytics techniques in an application area, for example relating the visual encodings and interaction techniques to the requirements of the target task. Similarly, Application papers have been the norm when researchers describe the use of visualization techniques to glean insights from problems in engineering and science. Although a significant amount of application domain background information can be useful to provide a framing context in which to discuss the specifics of the target task, the primary focus of the case study must be the visualization content. The results of the Application / Design Study, including insights generated in the application domain, should be clearly conveyed. Describing new techniques and algorithms developed to solve the target problem will strengthen a design study paper, but the requirements for novelty are less stringent than in a Technique paper. Where necessary, the identification of the underlying parametric space and its efficient search must be aptly described. The work will be judged by the design lessons learned or insights gleaned, on which future contributors can build. We invite submissions on any application area.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation papers</strong> explore the usage of visualization and visual analytics by human users, and typically present an empirical study of visualization techniques or systems. Authors are not necessarily expected to implement the systems used in these studies themselves; the research contribution will be judged on the validity and importance of the experimental results as opposed to the novelty of the systems or techniques under study. The conference committee appreciates the difficulty and importance of designing and performing rigorous experiments, including the definition of appropriate hypotheses, tasks, data sets, selection of subjects, measurement, validation and conclusions. The goal of such efforts should be to move from mere description of experiments, toward prediction and explanation. We do suggest that potential authors who have not had formal training in the design of experiments involving human subjects may wish to partner with a colleague from an area such as psychology or human-computer interaction who has experience with designing rigorous experimental protocols and statistical analysis of the resulting data. Other novel forms of evaluation are also encouraged.</p>
<p><strong>Theory/Model papers</strong> present new interpretations of the foundational theory of visualization and visual analytics. Implementations are usually not relevant for papers in this category. Papers should focus on basic advancement in our understanding of how visualization techniques complement and exploit properties of human vision and cognition.</p>

<h2 id="VisNotes">Visualization Notes</h2>
<p>The <a href="/pvis2018/">11th IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis 2018)</a> will be held in Kobe, Japan during April 10 to 13, 2018. Visualization has become an increasingly important research area due to its wide range of applications in many disciplines. PacificVis is an IEEE sponsored international visualization symposium held in the Asia-Pacific region, with the objective to foster greater exchange between visualization researchers and practitioners, and to draw more researchers in the Asia-Pacific region to enter this rapidly growing area of research.</p>
<p>PacificVis 2018 features a short paper track, called “Visualization Notes.” The purpose of this track is to encourage young researchers to present their work and discuss with participants including senior researchers there. The submissions can be late-breaking results and work in progress, while they should be novel enough to attract interest from the visualization community.</p>
<p>The suggested topics for the “Visualization Notes” are the same as <a href="#topics">those for full papers</a>, while the ideas there can be relatively small as compared with those for full papers. Nonetheless, the “Visualization Notes” are still expected to contain technically interesting results in theories and/or applications. Please note that all submissions must be original and thus have not been published elsewhere. All submitted papers will be peer-reviewed through a single-stage process by the international program committee. Accepted short papers will be included in the conference proceedings and in IEEE digital library.</p>

The purpose of this contest is to encourage students and researchers to demonstrate the value of their visualization research through effective visual data storytelling, and to contribute to this exciting development in the broader visualization community.</p>
<p>PacificVis is a unified visualization symposium, welcoming all areas of visualization such as: information, scientific, graph, security, and software visualization. Storytellers are invited to submit visual data-driven stories that draw upon any of these areas. Unlike contests such as the VAST challenge or the SciVis Contest, the data for the PacificVis visual data storytelling contest will be left unspecified; storytellers are free to choose any publicly-available dataset(s). Similarly, the task that storytellers are to accomplish is to successfully communicate a message or series of messages (i.e., a narrative, a series of insights) using visualization techniques and supported by the underlying data. The themes of the story can draw from any topic, including current affairs, history, natural disasters, and research findings from the sciences and humanities.</p>

<section class="container marketing lead" align="justify" level="2">
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Submissions can take several forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Website: an author-hosted website is preferred, however authors may opt to submit a <code>.zip</code> archive of a website containing all dependencies and a readme <code>.txt</code> or <code>.md</code> file with instructions on how to view the website locally. Authors submitting a website are also highly encouraged to submit a <code>.zip</code> archive containing screenshots and/or a video capture of the website via PCS as a fallback in the event that the contest chairs and judges are unable to view the website. Authors are encouraged to use interactive and animated elements that advance the story, such as scrollytelling waypoints or stepper navigation controls. Websites that require the viewer to engage in substantial exploratory interaction are discouraged.</p></li>
<li><p>Video: <code>.mp4</code>, <code>.avi</code>, or <code>.mov</code> formats are preferred, with a maximum length of 5 minutes. Note that video submissions that appear to be tutorials or demonstrations of a visualization tool will not be considered; the focus of the submission must be a visual narrative about the data, not a visualization tool or technique.</p></li>
<li><p>Data Comic: a multi-page <code>.pdf</code> file that tells a story in the style of a comic book.</p></li>
<li><p>Infographic: a single-page poster <code>.pdf</code> file that tells a story.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A succinct story title or headline.</p></li>
<li><p>A 150-word extended abstract using the <a href="http://junctionpublishing.org/vgtc/Tasks/camera.html"><em>IEEE VGTC poster template</em></a> that briefly describes the data analysis and design process undertaken by the storyteller(s). The abstract should not include the message(s) communicated by the story; the story must stand alone in this regard such that a viewer should not need to read the abstract to understand the story. If submitting the story as a website, authors must include the URL of the story in this abstract.</p></li>
<li><p>A list of references that include the publicly-available dataset(s) that informed the story and those that are visually represented within the story, as well as any tools, libraries, previously published techniques, or software applications used during the data analysis and story design process.</p></li>
<li><p>The story must feature at least one programmatically-generated visual representation of data; visual representations of data generated by manual illustration (e.g., on paper, using illustration software) are allowed; however, these representations must be used in conjunction with a programmatically-generated visual representations of data. In addition, the programmatically-generated visual representation(s) should be the authors’ own work, using techniques or tools created by the authors. Third party techniques or applications may be used in conjunction with the authors’ own work as long as proper credit is given to their respective creators and it is made clear which aspects of the implementation represent the authors’ own work.</p></li>
<li><p>The entries must be original data-driven stories that have not been previously published elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>For the winning entries we expect the following additional requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least one member of the winning team must register for the conference and be present at the contest’s poster session and award ceremony.</li>

<h2 id="PacificVAST">PacificVAST 2018 Call for Papers</h2>
<p>PacificVAST 2018 is an international workshop collocated with <a href="/pvis2018/">PacificVis 2018</a>. The workshop is held on April 10th, the first day of the symposium.</p>
<p>In PacificVAST, participants share their state-of-the-art research results and fresh perspectives on visual analytics. Visual analytics is a discipline concerned with science and technology for analytical reasoning supported by interactive visual interfaces. Most papers presented in PacificVAST are distinguished from traditional visualization papers in that they harmoniously integrate interactive visual interfaces with analytical techniques from statistics, data mining, or machine learning fields to help analyze overwhelming amounts of disparate, conflicting, and dynamic information.</p>
<p>All aspects of visual analytics are covered in PacificVAST including, but not limited to the following topics:</p>
<dl>
<dt>The science of analytical reasoning</dt>
<dd>Visually enabled tools to support (collaborative) analytic reasoning about complex and dynamic problems Scalable visual analytic techniques
</dd>
<dt>Visual representations and interaction techniques</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>Theories and techniques of visual representations based on cognitive and perceptual principles that can be deployed through engineered, reusable components</li>
<li>Novel visual paradigms that support the (collaborative) analytical reasoning process</li>
<li>Theories and techniques of user interactions that support the analytical reasoning process</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Data representations, transformations, and integrations</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>Theory and practice for transforming data into new scalable representations that faithfully represent the content of the underlying data</li>
<li>Methods to synthesize information of different types and from different sources into a unified data representation</li>
<li>Methods and principles for representing data quality, reliability, and certainty measures throughout the data transformation and analysis process</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Techniques and systems for production, presentation, and dissemination of analysis results</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>Methodology and tools that enable the capture of the analytic assessment, decision recommendations, and first responder actions into information packages</li>
<li>Technologies and systems that enable analysts to communicate what they know through the use of appropriate visual metaphor and accepted principles of reasoning and graphic representation</li>
<li>Techniques and tools that enable effective use of limited, mobile forms of technologies to support situation assessment by first responders</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Methodologies and benchmarks for evaluating visual analytics techniques and systems</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>Infrastructure to facilitate evaluation of new visual analytics technologies</li>
<li>Ecologically valid evaluation methods for visual analytics tools</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For fostering a stronger visual analytics community in the Asia-Pacific region, PacificVAST starts a new publishing model this year: ALL accepted papers will be published in a special issue of the <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/visual-informatics/">Elsevier Journal of Visual Informatics</a> on the day of the workshop.</p>
